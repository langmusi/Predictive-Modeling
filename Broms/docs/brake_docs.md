1. bromskivor = brake disc

One wheel has two brake discs.

2. Two brake discs at one side of a train.
One brake is located at the inside of the wheel, the other one at the outside of the wheel. 

3. Important variables:

- Brakes' position
- If a train stops many times, the number of stops impacts wear of brakes.
- Tracks of trains and the types of trains' usage. The curves make a train slowing down which impacts brakes. If a train alreay moves slowly, then a curve track will not have much impact on brake wear.
