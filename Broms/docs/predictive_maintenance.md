## Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL)
Regression models to predict remaining useful lifetime (RUL)
Remaining useful lifetime (RUL) is the length of time equipment is predicted to operate before it requires repair or replacement. Regression models for the RUL require available static and historical data with labeled events.

The data that can be used to determine RUL is the following:

- Data that indicates how long similar equipment worked before it reached failure
- Run-to-failure data collected from similar machines
- A known threshold value of a condition indicator that detects failures

As a result, you will have information about how many days or cycles are left before the system fails.
